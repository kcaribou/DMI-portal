## Laravel DMI portal admin panel

This is a Laravel 5.4 adminpanel starter project with roles-permissions management based on [Spatie Laravel-permission package](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-permission), [AdminLTE theme](https://adminlte.io/) and [Datatables.net](https://datatables.net).

## Usage

This is not a package - it's a full Laravel project that you should use as a starter boilerplate, and then add your own custom functionality.

- Clone the repository with `git clone`
- Copy `.env.example` file to `.env` and edit database credentials there
- Run `composer install`
- Run `php artisan key:generate`
- Execute .sql on Mysql
- That's it: launch the main URL and login with default credentials `admin@admin.com` - `password`
